# Text Mining Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on text mining using various Python libraries. It includes data processing, machine learning model training, and data visualization. The project is designed to be run in Google Colab.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (for execution)
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - TensorFlow & Keras
  - NLTK
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - NetworkX
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Plotly

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
3. Google Colab typically comes with most libraries pre-installed. If a library is missing, you can install it using `!pip install <library-name>` within a Colab cell.

## Execution Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) in Google Colab.
2. Mount your Google Drive if the dataset is stored there, as seen in the initial cells.
3. Run each cell in sequence from top to bottom. Some cells may take longer to execute due to model training or complex data processing.
4. Ensure all necessary data files are accessible in the specified paths.
